## The HTTP protocol
---
## General description
- Application level protocol
- Request-response protocol
- Synchronous communication
---
## General description
- Transmits text data
- Communication is initiated by the client
- Stateless protocol
---
## Request-response protocol
- The http communication session is formed out of a client request and a server response
- State is not maintained between successive requests
- To maintain application state, headers are used (either via sessions or via cookies)
---
## Synchronous communication
- After performing the quest, the client waits for a response
- Upon getting the response, the client loads the received content
- An alternative way of (organizing communication) is AJAX, in which a HTTP connection is kept open
---
## Web servers
- Deliver web resources
- May execute code via language specific containers
- May have features for virtual hosting, securitate etc.
- Apache, NGINX, IIS etc.
---
## Web resources
- Not necessarily files
- Not necessarily text resouces (although binary resources will be encoded as text)
- The resource type is defined through MIME types
- Two perspectives on the resource, remote and local
---
## Addressing schemes
- URL(Uniform Resource Locator) - a resource location
- URN (Uniform Resource Name) - the name of a resource 
- URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) - the unique identifier of a resource
---
## URL
- Contains the characters of the English language, the digits from and -_~.
- Additionally, other characters can be used using "percent encoding" e.g. space is usable as %20
- There is an extension of the standard which allows URLs containing all UTF-8 encoded unicode characters
---
## URL
- URLs are used for HTTP, but also FTP, JDBC etc.
- General form: *schema://server:port/cale?parametri#fragment*
- schema - identifies the protocol being used and the elements used in the URL
- server - the name or address of the server; one can be obtaind from the other via DNS (Domain Name Service)
---
## URL
- port - identifies the application running on the destination server; the browser assumes port 80 (the well known port), but any unoccupied port can be used
- parameters - list of key value pairs separated by & e.g. name=Andrei&age=32
- fragment - in principles identifies a position (bookmark) within a document
---
## HTTP methods
- **OPTIONS** - returns the set of methods supported on a URL
- **GET** - gets the resource
- **HEAD** - gets only the headers, not the resource itself
- **POST** - asks the server to add a subresource to the resource at the address
---
## Metode HTTP
- **PUT** - asks the server to replace a resource
- **DELETE** - asks the server to delete a resource
- **PATCH** - asks the server to update a resource
---
## The HTTP request
- A request line specifying the method and address
- Some number of headers
- An empty line
- (Optional) a request body
---
## Response codes
- 1xx - informative
- 2xx - success
- 3xx - redirect
- 4xx - client-side error
- 5xx - server-side error
---
## The HTTP response
- A status line, containing the response code and justification
- Some number of headrs
- An empty line
- (Optional) a response body
---
## Multimedia content
- Covers not ascii text, images, video etc.
- The type of the content is specified as a MIME type
- Multimedia data must be encoded (i.e. Base64 encoding) since the protocol transfers text
- The type of the content is specified via the Content-Type header
---
## HTTP mechanisms
- Headers are key-value paris through which the behavior of the protocol is extended
- Can store the content type, length, the possibility of compression etc.
---
## HTTP mechanisms
- Redirects - when the server cannot deliver a resource, but can specify a location where it can be found it replies with a code 3--
- The client will request the resource from the new location, possibly going through successive redirects until it get either a success or an error code
---
## HTTP mechanisms
- ETAG - a special redirect case
- Each resource is associated a key (the ETAG)
- When the client asks for a resource it has cached, it also send the ETag (via the If-None-Match header)
- If that correspons with the key the server has, the server replies with  304, otherwise, the server sends the current version of the resource
---
## HTTP mechanisms
- There are also additional caching schemes, such as with the headers cache-control È™i expires
---
## Mecanisme HTTP
- Sessions and cookies
- asynchoronous HTTP
- Compression
---
## REST
- Main features of REpresentational State Transfer
- Remote object access over HTTP
- Limited vocabulary
- Identifying the semantics of the request from the URL
---
## JSON
- (one of) the native representations of JavaScript objects
- Simple, without the necessity to specify types
- Does not contain a discovery mechanism
---
## Miscelaneous
- REST API's
- Clean URLs
- HTTPS
---
## HTTP/2
- Keeps most of the HTTP 1.1 mechanisms
- Based on SPDY
- Binary protocol
- Organized in frames, where a frame can have a different content (headers, data etc.)
---
## HTTP/2
- Introduces header, method, url etc. compression at connection level, not at request level
- Works (in practice) only over TLS; the encrypted connection requirement is not in the standard, but exists in all implementations
---
## HTTP/2
- Eliminates the blocking elements of version 1
- Multiple resouces can be requested over one connection and the server can deliver them in any order
- Resources are delivered in resource streams which can be prioritized
- The server can also send resources which have not yet been requested by the client
