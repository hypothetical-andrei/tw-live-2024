## JS
---
## Hello JS
```js
console.log('hello world!')
```

---
## JS characteristics
- Multiparadigm language (imperative, functional, object-oriented)
- Interpreted language
- Has dynamic types, determinable and modifiable at runtime
- Initially client-side, but now also server-side

---
## JS characteristics
- Fundamentlly asynchronous
- Uses the unicode character set
- Case sensitive

---
## Client-side JS vs Server-side JS
- Client-side js extends the language with browser specific objects
- Server-side js extends the language with server specific objects
- Both work on an asynchronous model

---
## Variables
```js
var a
console.log(a)
console.log(typeof a)
// console.log(b)
```

---
## Data types
 - (Almost) a purely object oriented language (primitive types exist, but can be autoboxed)
 - Has simple and complex types

---
## Data types
- String, Number și Boolean wrap primitive types
- Array and Object
- Special data types: null and undefined
- Symbol

---
## Primitive types
- string
- number
- boolean

---
## String
- Character strings, delimited by "" by '' or by ``

```js
var name = "Andrei";
var surname = 'Toma';
var somestring = "i can ‘switch’ quotes"
```
- Can include C-style escape sequences
```js
var myString = "i can ‘ quote a \" quote "
```

---
## Number
- All numbers are floating point
- Number primitive are boxed in Number objects
- Can be written with or without a fractional part
```js
var x = 3.14
var y = 3
var  z = new Number(10)
```

---
## Dynamic data types, string and number
```js
a = 5
console.log(a)
console.log(typeof a)
```

```js
a = 'a string'
console.log(a)
console.log(typeof a)
```


---
## The boolean type and truthiness
- Can only contain the values true and false
```js
var isTrue = true
var isFalse = false
```
- Truthy values and falsy values
- Falsy values: false, string-ul vid, numerele 0 și -0, undefined, null and NaN
- All other values are truthy

---
## The boolean type and truthiness
```js
if (!""){
    console.log("empty string false")
}
if (!0){
    console.log("0 false")
}
if (!NaN){
    console.log("NaN false")
}
```

---
## The boolean type and truthiness
```js
if (!false){
    console.log("false false")
}
if (!null){
    console.log("null false")
}
if (!undefined){
    console.log("undefined false")
}
```

---
## Arrays
- Arrays are 0 based and actually represent a list of objects
```js
var brands=["Microsoft","Apple","IBM"]
var empty = new Array()
var names = new Array("Andrei","Ana","George")
```

---
## Complex data types - array
```js
let a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
console.log(a[0])
a.unshift(-1)
console.log(a)
console.log(a.pop())
console.log(a)
```

---
## The object type
- JS is a prototype based language
- There exists a hierachy of objects that have as an initial prototype object
- Objects are serializable in JSON and can be processed in this form
- Objects behave similarly (and can be used as) hash tables

---
## Objets
- Declaring an object is done either with the new operator or a JSON initializer
```js
var person = { name: "Andrei", age: 32 }
var car = new Car("Dacia")
```
- The JSON variant allows for inline object creating, without any previous definition steps, whilst the other runs a constructor function over a memory area (similar to other languages)

---
## Complex data types - object
```js
let o = {
    a: 1,
    b: 'a string'
}
console.log(o)
console.log(JSON.stringify(o, null, 2))

```

---
## Functions and methods
```js
let o = {
    a: 1,
    b: 'a string'
}
function f() {
  console.log('i am a function')
}
f()
let f1 = f
f1()
o.doStuff = f1
o.doStuff()
console.log('')
```

---
## Special data types
- null - represents a variable with a defined type, but which does not contain a reference to an actual object
- undefined - represents a variable with an undefined type

---
## Type comparisons
```js
a = 5
b = '5'
console.log(a == b)
console.log(a === b)
```

---
## Conversions
- Number to String
```js
var s = new String(19)
var s = (1984).toString()
```
- Other methods toExponential(), toFixed(), toPrecision()
- Boolean to String
```js
var s = new String(false)
var s = false.toString() 
```

---
## Explicit converions
- String to Number
```js
var s = new Number("5") //rezultatul este 5
var s = new Number("") //rezultatul este 0
var s = new Number("abc") //rezultatul este NaN
parseInt("5.2")
parseFloat("5.2")
```
- isNaN() can be used to verify the result of the conversion

---
## Explicit conversions
```js
let s = '5.5'
console.log(parseInt(s))
console.log(parseFloat(s))
console.log(parseInt('a kitten'))
```

---
## Autoboxing
```js
console.log('a string'.toUpperCase())
```

---
## Implicit conversions
- adding a string to a number will produce a string
- adding a string to an object will produce a string
- printing an object to the console will convert the object to string

---
## Operatori
- Arithmetic operators
- Attribution operators
- String operators
- Operators between different types
- Bitwise operators
- Comparison operators
- Other operators

---
## Arithmetic operators
- Assuming 2 number operants:
  - a + b is their sum
  - a - b is their difference
  - a / b is the result of real division
  - a * b is the product
  - a % b is the remainder of integer division
  - a++ increments a
  - a-- decrements a

---
## Attribution operators
- Sets the value of the left operand to the result of the evaluation of the right one
  - a = b
  - a += b
  - a -= b
  - a %= b
  - a /= b
  - a *= b

---
## String operators
- Operators + and += are overloaded to support string concatenation and attribution with concatenation

---
## Operands applied to different types
- Applying + between a String and a Number produces a string
- Since both are objects, what happens is our string is concatenated with the result of calling the toString method of the Number object

---
## Bitwise operators
- All operations work with 32 bit numbers
- Operatori bitwise
  - & bitwise and
  - | bitwise or
  - ^ bitwise xor
  - ~ bitwise not
  - << left shift
  - \>\> right shift
  - \>\>\> right shift with 0 padding

---
## Comparison operators
- The result is a Boolean
  - a == b  a is equal to b
  - a != b a is not equal to b
  - a > b a is greater than b
  - a >= b a is greater or equal to b
  - a < b a is less than b
  - a <= b a is less or equal to b
  - a === b a is equal to b and they have the same type
  - a !== b a is not equal to b, or they don't havfe the same type

---
## Other operators
- typeof returns the type of the operang
- unary \+ converts a string to number explicitly 
- delete deletes a property of an object or an element of an array
- void evaluates an expression and returns undefined

---
## Other operators
- in - returns true if the property is present on the object
```js
"name" in Person
```
- instanceof returns true if the first operand has the second operand in its prototype chain
```js
"somestring" instanceof Object; //false
new String(“test”) instanceof String; //true
```

---
## Other operators
- spread operator - destructures an array or an object
```js
var a = [1,2,3]
var b = [4,5]
var c = [...a,...b];//c este [1,2,3,4,5]
var d = [a,b];//c este[[1,2,3],[4,5]]
```
